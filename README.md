# PG7

A collection of projects for the final semester of undergrad CS.

### JPA & PLANET

The main goal of those courses was to learn how to .NET and WPF.
The most interesting thing here is [FieldCelluarAutomaton](https://github.com/tad1/PG7/tree/master/PLANET/FieldCelluarAutomaton) - a game of life but on complex numbers w/ custom rules.

### RAI

This one was about JavaScript and everything around it.
Nothing interesting here.
